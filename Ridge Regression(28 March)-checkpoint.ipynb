    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression is a statistical method that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, but adds a penalty term to the cost function that penalizes large coefficients.\n",
    "This makes the regression coefficients shrink towards zero, which makes the model less complex and more generalizable to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a method that minimizes the sum of squared residuals without adding any penalty term.\n",
    "This can sometimes lead to overfitting, which is when the model fits the training data too well and does not generalize well to new data.    \n",
    " \n",
    "Here are some additional points to consider:\n",

    "->Ridge regression is a regularization technique.\n",
    "  Regularization is a way to prevent overfitting by shrinking the coefficients of the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some additional details about each assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "->Independent variables are not perfectly correlated: This assumption is important because if the independent variables are perfectly correlated, then the ridge regression coefficients will not be unique.\n",
    "->Dependent variable is normally distributed: This assumption is not as critical as the other assumptions, but it is still important. If the dependent variable is not normally distributed, then the ridge regression coefficients may not be accurate.\n",
    "->Errors are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.): This assumption means that the errors are not correlated with each other and that they have the same distribution. This assumption is important because if the errors are not i.i.d., then the standard errors of the ridge regression coefficients may not be accurate.\n",
    "->Errors have a constant variance: This assumption means that the variance of the errors is the same for all values of the independent variables. This assumption is important because if the variance of the errors is not constant, then the standard errors of the ridge regression coefficients may not be accurate.\n",

    "A larger value of λ will result in a less variable model, but it will also have more bias.\n",

    "There are several methods for selecting the value of λ. One common method is cross-validation. \n",

    "->The value of λ should be chosen so that the coefficients are not too small. If the coefficients are too small, then the model will not be able to capture the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.\n",

    "    \n",
    "Ridge regression can be used for feature selection. Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of features that are most relevant to the prediction task. Ridge regression can be used for feature selection by setting the penalty term (λ) to a large value. This will cause the ridge regression coefficients to shrink towards zero, and only the coefficients for the most important features will remain significant.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to note that ridge regression does not always select the same features as other feature selection methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:=\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ridge regression is a regularization technique that can be used to improve the performance of a linear regression model in the presence of multicollinearity. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated. This can cause problems with the linear regression model, such as:\n",

    "->The coefficients of the model may be unstable and unreliable.\n",
    "->The standard errors of the coefficients may be large.\n",
    "->The model may be sensitive to small changes in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression addresses these problems by shrinking the coefficients of the model towards zero.\n",
    "This reduces the impact of multicollinearity on the model and makes it more stable and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of shrinkage is controlled by a tuning parameter called the penalty term. \n",
    "The penalty term is typically denoted by the Greek letter lambda (λ). A larger value of λ will cause more shrinkage, while a smaller value of λ will cause less shrinkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal value of λ depends on the data and the desired trade-off between bias and variance. \n",
